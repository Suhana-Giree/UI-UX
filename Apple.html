                        <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in
                            Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It is best known for its consumer electronics,
                            software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve
                            Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple
                            Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had
                            expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology
                            company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year.

                            The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its
                            second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced
                            microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the
                            first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company
                            problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures;
                            John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost
                            considerable market share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel
                            duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones. In 1997, Apple
                            was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought
                            NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability
                            over the next decade with the introductions of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices to
                            critical acclaim as well as the iTunes Store, launching the "Think different" advertising
                            campaign, and opening the Apple Store retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to
                            consistently be one of the world's most valuable brands since about 2010. Jobs resigned in
                            2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.</p>

                        <p>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and
                            Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[8][11] The company's first product is the Apple I, a
                            computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[12] To finance its creation, Jobs
                            sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[13]: 57  Neither
                            received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in
                            2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July
                            1976.[14] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video
                            chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer.[15]
                            It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[16][17]: 180 
                            Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number
                            666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[18]

                        <p>Since the company's founding and into the early 2000s, Apple primarily sold computers,
                            which are marketed as Macintosh since the mid-1980s. Since then, the company has
                            expanded its product categories to include various portable devices, starting with the
                            now discontinued iPod (2001), and later with the iPhone (2007) and iPad (2010). Apple
                            also sells several other products that it categorizes as "Wearables, Home and
                            Accessories", such as the Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods, HomePod, and Apple Vision Pro.

                        <p>According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm
                            while on a fruitarian diet.[190] Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir
                            Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob
                            Janoff's "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a
                            bite taken out of it.[191] This logo has been erroneously referred to as a tribute to
                            Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.[192]

                            provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[340] Apple has received regulatory
                            approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane
                            emissions to generate electricity.[341] Apple's North Carolina data center is already
                            powered entirely by renewable sources.[342]

                        <p>In 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward
                            the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which
                            puts Apple in their top category "Striding".[343] This was an increase from May 2008,
                            when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last
                            among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a
                            "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the
                            climate-conscious consumer".[344]</p>
